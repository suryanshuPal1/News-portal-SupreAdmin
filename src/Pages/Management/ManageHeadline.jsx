              A court in West Bengal has directed the production of individuals
              linked to a Bangladesh-based terror outfit who are currently lodged in
              an Assam jail. The order comes as part of an ongoing investigation
              into cross-border terrorism and illegal activities. Authorities are
              expected to transport the suspects for further legal proceedings,
              shedding light on the regional security concerns and coordinated
              efforts between Indian states to tackle extremist networks. A court in
